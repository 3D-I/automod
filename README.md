__Note: AutoMOD is only available for phpBB 3.0.x.
AutoMOD is incompatible with phpBB 3.1.x and attempts to install and use it could result in board failures. phpBB 3.1.x has its own way of handling extensions and a tool like AutoMOD is no longer needed.
Modifications for phpBB 3.0.x cannot be installed on phpBB 3.1.x and could result in a broken board if you force the install or install them manually.__
